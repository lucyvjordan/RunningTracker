# Running Tracker

ğŸ’« I made this program to track my running so that I could see my progress visualised.

---

### Features
ğŸ’™ This program uses python, tkinter and matplotlib.

ğŸ’™ Inputting only the data, distance and time taken, this program will show you additional data like average speed and average pace. 

ğŸ’™ There is an option to choose between a light and dark mode.

ğŸ’™ Users' data is stored in an external csv file which can be easily loaded in and appended to so that data does not need to be re-entered each time.

### Future Development
Ideas that I would like to implement in future include:

ğŸ’¡ Authentication, so that users on the same system cannot access each others data.

ğŸ’¡ A dedicated 5k section so that users can track their 5k times.
